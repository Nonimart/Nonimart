### 🍍 Hi There 👋

I'm a Full Stack developper with a particular focus on Front-end and Design. 
I am passionate about design and interface development. Graduated from a graphic design school, I love to work on interesting digital projects but also on identity design & branding, editorial, and graphic projetcs.
